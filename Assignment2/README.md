#Description:
#This program is a python program that executes SQLite commands based on user input.
#This is the main file which implements two other classes, Menu and Student, and calls the functions.
#I Used this video for class construction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s . It's also why I tried 
#using different naming conventions (like student_id instead of studentID). I think these are the proper
#python naming conventions.
#I had some problems with getting the database to work... sometimes it would make its own database,
#sometimes the functions would only run when a database was already made in PyCharm/Datagrip.
