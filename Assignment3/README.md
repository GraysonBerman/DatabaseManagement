Assignment 3

This assignment required me to make a Database with five tables. 
The five tables are: 
1) Persons (Personid, fullName, firstName, and lastName)
2) ContactInfo (Personid, email, phoneNum)
3) BillingInfo (Personid, creditCardNum, creditCardSecCode)
4) Location (Personid, state, city)
5) ProfileInfo (Personid, occupation, dateOfBirth, gender, state, city)

I made fake data using pycharm. The file is called FakerDataGenerator.py
It allows input to make a file with a .csv extension. It allows input to choose how many tuples to make.
It has these attributes: 
fullName, firstName, lastName, gender, email, phoneNum, state, city, occupation, dateOfBirth, creditCardNum, creditCardSecCode
It prints out to a CSV file. I provided a CSV file in the repo called FakerData.csv
